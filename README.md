Projectâ€™s title : 
# Report on the German Credit dataset 


# Project structure 
It is divided in 6 files:
- 'intro.Rmd' contains the introduction of our project 
- 'data.Rmd' contains a first overview of the data and the data cleaning 
- 'eda.Rmd' contains the exploratory data analysis of the cleaned dataset
- 'analysis.Rmd' contains the analysis of our project. 
- 'concl.Rmd' contains the conclusion and limitations of our project 
  - The file 'concl.Rmd' cannot be knitted on its own as it includes the annexe part. In this section, some chunck code from others 'child' files are required. 
- 'report.Rmd' is used to put our different parts of the project together. 

# Use our code 
In order to run the whole report, one has to knit the file named 'report.Rmd'. It can be knitted into html or pdf without any problem. 

The file 'setup.R' contains all the packages and libraries used during the project.
